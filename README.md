After more than a decade of experience as a live sound engineer and production manager for concert venues, I decided to transition to a new career as a software developer. I figured that lockdown was a great opportunity to try something new, so I decided to attend Flatiron School and graduated in May of 2023. I'm looking forward to learning and growing as a software developer in the years to come.

## Applications:

### Recipe Manager (JavaScript)

[Recipe Manager (JavaScript)](https://github.com/loren-michael/phase-1-project "Recipe Manager (JS)")

This was the first app that I build for a Flatiron project. It uses basic DOM manipulation to show a list of recipes from an included JSON database, and also allows you to add your own recipes to the list. The functionality is very basic, and does not include any validations or the ability to delete recipes without editing the database directly.

### Recipe Manager (React)

My second app is another Recipe Manager - I guess I really wanted to expand on that idea! This time around, I utilized Semantic UI cards to my home page for a better display and also included the ability to "favorite" a recipe and leave a comment.

### Character Manager (Ruby/Sinatra/React)

[Character Manager Backend](https://github.com/loren-michael/phase-3-sinatra-react-project "Character Manager Backend")

This simple app was designed to demonstrate knowledge of Ruby with Sinatra. It allows you to create and manage the levels of D&D characters.

### Movie Rental App (Ruby on Rails, React)

[Movie Rental App](https://github.com/loren-michael/phase-4-project-final "Movie Rental App")

## This app was meant to go a little deeper into my understanding of Ruby on Rails, while also learning useContext and how to access state from a central location.
