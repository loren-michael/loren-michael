# Hi! I'm Loren and this is my Github!

After more than a decade of experience as a sound engineer and production manager for local Chicago venues, I decided to transition to a new career as a software developer. I decided to attend Flatiron School and graduated in May of 2023. I'm looking forward to learning and growing as a software developer in the years to come.

Directly below, you can see a handful of applications that I built as school projects. I'm proud of these works, and hope to return to update and polish them in the future.

## Applications:

---

### Recipe Manager (JavaScript)

[Recipe Manager](https://github.com/loren-michael/phase-1-project "Recipe Manager")

This was the first app that I build for a Flatiron project. It uses JavaScript and DOM manipulation to show a list of recipes from a database, and also allows you to add your own recipes to the list.
